# Code-Generator Contribution Guide

Hi! Thanks for your interest in contributing to Code-Generator.
Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guide:

## Development Setup

You will need Nodejs LTS v14.16.x, VSCode, Vetur, and pnpm package manager.

- Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as per your OS.

- Install [Vetur extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur) to get syntax highlighting for `.vue` files. You can search `Vetur` in VSCode Extensions Tab to install.

- Install Nodejs LTS v14.16.x from https://nodejs.org for macOS and Windows. For Linux distributions, please follow the steps from [Node.js Website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and [NodeSource GitHub](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md#installation-instructions).

- Install pnpm from https://pnpm.io/installation. Use standalone script if there is a root issue with installing with npm.

- Install the dependencies with `pnpm install` in the project root directory. This might take a while to install.

- Run `pnpm run dev` to start local development server and starts editing the codes in the `src` directory. Changes will be updated on the app.

- If you want to test building the app locally, run `pnpm run build`. This will generate the `dist` directory which contains all the codes for the app to run from CDN or web server. You can test the built codes in the `dist` with `pnpm run serve`. However, changes won't be updated on the app with this command.

Please see `README.md` in the respective directories of `src` to see what the respective directory contains.

## Dependencies Explanation

Code-Generator mainly depends on

- Vue 3 – JavaScript framework to make the app reactive and maintain the state.
- Vite 2 – Front end build tool to bundle the app codes.
- Prismjs – For syntax highlighting.
- JSZip – For zipping the files in JS.
- FileSaver – For saving the zip files generated by JSZip with desired filename.
